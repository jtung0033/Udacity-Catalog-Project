# Video Game Systems and Games Catalog
I developed a web application that provides a database used to organize game systems and their corresponding games supported by that system. It includes and integratedd third party user registration and authentication in the form of a Google acount. Successful authentication should allow users to create, edit, and delete any items on the database.

## How to run the application:

1. Open the directory by the command line where the files are located.

2. Setup the database by running the code `python database_setup.py`

3. Run `python project.py` to start up the application.

4. Go to your browser with the address of http://localhost:5000 to access the application.
